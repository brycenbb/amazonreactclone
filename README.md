# My Amazon clone!

I took up this project to really test my React and broader Javascript and React skills in being able to create a diverse range of funtionalities. The project is hosted on Netlify [here](https://brycenreactamazonclone.netlify.app) . This is being developed alongside my 4-week team project at School of Code and thus will be updated less frequentyly than my normal projects. I have decided to tackle this behemoth of a project in chunks:


## Current Task
  Expanding the current implementation of Context API to include the complete structure of the cart items for display in the basket. This will include adding functionality to remove, add, and grouping items through quantity rather than having repeat items in the cart at a time, the latter of which will be done through giving unique IDs to each item listing.  

## Benchmarks

Home Page //Done!

Persistent Cart //Done!

Adding limitations to Semantic API for searching and re-integrate it

## Broader goals

Rating system
Review System

..and More!
