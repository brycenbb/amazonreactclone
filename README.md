# My Amazon clone!

I took up this project to really test my React and broader Javascript and React skills in being able to create a diverse range of funtionalities. The project is hosted on Netlify [here](https://brycenreactamazonclone.netlify.app) . This is being developed alongside my 4-week team project at School of Code and thus will be updated less frequentyly than my normal projects. I have decided to tackle this behemoth of a project in chunks:

## Current Task

Producing a components for each individual listing and adding reviews and the ability to create new
reviews that are tied to each item through their listing id.

## Benchmarks

Home Page //Done!

Persistent Cart //Done!

Full Context API integration for tracking items in both carts //Done!

Adding limitations to Semantic API for searching and re-integrate it

## Broader goals

Rating system
Review System

..and More!
